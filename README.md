## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This bot aims to solve the problem of manually assigning booked appointments to library rooms and sending two emails with the assignment. It provides a user-friendly interface to assign tutors to rooms, add appointments to the report, and send emails to both tutors and library admins. The bot also offers robust error handling and automatic deletion of old reports.

## 🎈 Features <a name = "features"></a>
1.**Assigning Tutors to Rooms**: The application assigns each tutor to a room, ensuring that there are no conflicts, i.e., no two appointments happen at the same time in the same room. If a tutor has two or more consecutive sessions, he is assigned to the same room.

2.**Adding Appointments to the Report**: Appointments can be added to the report through the application.

3.**Adding Appointments to Separate Email**: The application can add appointments to be sent separately via email for appointments scheduled on-the-spot.

4.**Removing Appointments**: Appointments can be removed from the report or from the appointments added to be sent separately.

5.**Email Preview**: The application provides an email preview, displaying the appointments **in the application** and/or **generating two HTML files** to display the final format of the email. This preview allows the user to check the email before sending it.

6.**Automatic Email Sending to Tutors**: The application sends emails automatically to tutors.

7.**Automatic Email Sending to Library Admins**: The application sends emails automatically to library admins.

8.**Robust Error Handling**: The application is robust against runtime errors and provides descriptive messages to guide the user.
