    <p>Dear tutors,</p>
    <p>I hope you're doing great.</p>
    <p>Kindly note the following schedule displays today's sessions with the assigned rooms for each tutoring session. Please check the room assigned to you.</p>
    <p>If you do not find a room assigned to you, it means you need to look for a quiet spot on campus. You can also try and reserve a library study room on your own.</p>
    <p>If you have any further questions, please let me know.</p>
    <table border="1" style="padding: 10px;">
      <tr>
        <th>Peer Tutor</th>
        <th>Tutee</th>
        <th>Appointment Date</th>
        <th>Appointment Time</th>
        <th>Room</th>
      </tr>
